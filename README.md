# Ansible---LearnLinuxTV

Following along with LearnLinuxTV Ansible tutorial

I started by setting up Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 VM in VirtualBox on my Windows 10 laptop, to
use as the controller machine, and also deployed 3x Ubuntu Server 22.04 VMs
on my Proxmox server to use as the test machines.

I will also deploy a CentOS VM, to follow more closely what Jay covers in his tutorial series.

Added public key to github repository, and cloned the repository to my Ubuntu workstation.

Created the inventory file and added the 3 hosts.
