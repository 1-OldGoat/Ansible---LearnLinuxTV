# Ansible---LearnLinuxTV

Following along with LearnLinuxTV Ansible tutorial

I started by setting up Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 VM in VirtualBox on my Windows 10 laptop,
also deployed 3x Ubuntu Server 22.04 VMs on my Proxmox server to use as the test machines.
I will also deploy a CentOS VM, to follow more closely what Jay covers in his tutorial series.
